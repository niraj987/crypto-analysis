# Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`crypto_analysis.ipynb`) that fetches historical cryptocurrency data from public APIs (using `yfinance`) and generates a technical analysis report.

It includes a Python package (`qfin`) that implements:

- **Data Fetching:** Pulls historical market data.
- **Technical Indicators:** Calculates Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), and the Relative Strength Index (RSI).

## How to use

1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance`
2. Open `crypto_analysis.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run all cells to view the plot and technical analysis of Bitcoin (or any other configured ticker).
